Learning Objectives
Sequences can be seen in the framework of loops. We can code some of famous sequences such that the Fibonacci’s sequence, Heron’s sequence, etc … We can also see the limit of the sequences and compare them. This point can help in the computation of the complexity of some algorithms.

Sequences
Arithmetic and Geometric sequences. 3. Recurrent sequences
Induction
Limits
Classic sequences
Requirements
C
